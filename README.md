#PureResponse HTTP Examples

An (unofficial) set of example files that illustrate how to use the Pure Response API end points in a variety of programming languages - offering reusable objects and modules.

##Motivation

I've built these through my own usage of the API and feel that they might benefit people out there looking to integrate with this platform and use the API.
